# 🎬 Resolvify 1.6
## A Linux-only OBS to DaVinci Resolve video converter

Resolvify exists for one simple reason:

Sometimes videos recorded in OBS will not import correctly into DaVinci Resolve on Linux.  
Resolvify converts those recordings into a format that Resolve can read reliably.

This tool is designed to be fast, safe, and easy to use while handling large batches of video files.
